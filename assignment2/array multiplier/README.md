Real-life Uses of Array Multipliers:
Microprocessors — for fast arithmetic in ALUs
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) — in audio, video, and image processing
Graphics Processing (GPUs) — for 3D transformations and rendering
Encryption — used in hardware for secure data processing
AI/ML Accelerators — for matrix multiplication in deep learning
They are used wherever high-speed multiplication is needed in hardware.
